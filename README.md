## Introduction:

In Production-grade deployment it is always a challenge for anyone who wants to give a demo in their environment with a WAF deployment.  Usually, it takes at least a few weeks for an average team to design and implement a production-grade WAF in a cloud environment because for each cloud deployment virtual networking, infrastructure security, Virtual Machine images, auto-scaling, logging, monitoring, automation, and many more topics requires detailed analysis. Also, most of well-made WAF deployments follow a similar path and become similar at the end. To mitigate this time and effort, we came up with a conclusion that a proper WAF deployment can be templatized and automated. So, a team doesnâ€™t need to spend much time on deployment and maintenance but starts to use a WAF from day zero. 
In this article we introduced a project that implements a Cloud Formation templates to deploy production-grade WAF in Azure cloud just in a few clicks and few runs.The WAF is using NGINX App Protect official image which is available under AZURE marketplace that eliminates the need to manually prebuild the AMI for your WAF deployment. It contains all the necessary code and packages on top of the OS of your choice. Also, allows you to pay as you go for NGINX App Protect software instead of purchasing a year-long license. 


## Why Azure?

Globally, 90% of Fortune 500 companies are using Microsoft Azure to drive their business. Using deeply integrated Azure cloud services, enterprises can rapidly build, deploy, and manage simple to complex applications with ease. Azure supports a wide range of programming languages, frameworks, operating systems, databases, and devices, allowing enterprises to leverage tools and technologies they trust.
Here are the reasons received from the customers who are deploying their deployments in Azure.
*	Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) capabilities
*	Security Offerings, Scalability and Ductility
*	Integrated Environment with Other Microsoft Tools
*	Cost Efficient and Interoperability

### Major components:

* ARM template  (git repository with the source of data plane and security configuration):
  * The Pipeline runs the ARM templates which will connect to the azure portal and deploys the solution. Also, user can directly login to the Azure portal and can run the template under Template Spec which will deploy the solution directly.
* Auto-scaling (data plane based on official NGINX App Protect AWS AMI images):
  * The amount of incoming traffic and the configured rule sets by using the official NGINX App Protect AZURE AMIs to spin up new Virtual Machine instances. It also removes the operational headache and optimizes costs since WAF dynamically adjusts the amount of computing resources and charges a user on an as-you-go basis.
* Visibility (dashboards displaying the WAF health and security data):
  * The template sets up a set of visibility dashboards in Azure Dashboard Service. Data plane VMs send logs and metrics to Dashboard service that visualizes incoming data as a set of charts and graphs showing WAF health and security violations.
  * Dashboard Example:

## Automation:

The following diagram represents the end-to-end automation solution. GitLab is used as a CI/CD platform. Gitlab pipeline sets up and configures the entire system from the ground up. The first stage creates all necessary Azure resources such as Azure AS, VMSS, Virtual machines, Load balancer out of official NGINX App Protect AMI image. Second stage sends the traffic including malicious and verifies the solution.

## How to Run:

* Pre-requisites:
  * Azure account and credentials.
  * Admin privileges to your azure resource group.
  * Service principal and password (follow link to create the service principal (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/create-an-azure-service-principal-azure-cli))
  * Resource group created in the azure portal.
* Add the below variables under github-->secrets
   * AZURE_SP --> Azure service principle
   * AZURE_PWD --> Azure client password
* Add your resource group and other params under Lib/azure-user-params file.
   mandatory params:
   * resourceGroup
   * tenandId
   * subscriptionId
* On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository and below repository name, click Actions tab.
* In the left sidebar select the workflow with name "Cloud Formation Template Deployment in Azure".
* Above the list of workflow runs, select Run workflow.
* Optionally you can select different branch(default is main) from available dropdown, and click on "Run Workflow" button to start executing the CICD.

## Enhancements:
* Added new testcase TC-2 which will validate the deployment with NGINX Custom Policy files having blocked mitigation action for trusted,untrusted and malicious traffic (web,API).

## Conclusion:

Therefore, the use of a template to deploy a cloud WAF allows to significantly reduce time spent on WAF deployment and maintenance. Also, it gives a complete and easy-to-use solution to deploy the resources and verify the NGINX solution in Azure platform in any location. Handy interfaces for configuration and visibility turn this project into a boxed solution allowing a user to easily operate a WAF and focus on application security.
Please comment if you find useful to have this kind of solution in major public clouds marketplaces.
It is a community project so far, and we need as much feedback as possible to steer one properly. Feel free to give it a try and leave feedback here or at the project's git repository.
